== Description ==

This plugin solves a problem of importing products as batch in WooCommerce. 

The biggest problem I faced when importing products in bulk was that you are either dependent on the REST API or you have to use a plugin that imports products in bulk.
The problem with the REST API is that it is very slow and it is not possible to import products in bulk. 
From my tests, importing via plugin was ~3.5 times faster than importing via REST API.

You can edit it to your needs. I have added some comments to help you understand the code.
